# INDEEDopt: INitial DEsign Enhanced Deep learning OPTimization framework for high dimensional ReaxFF force field parameterization




# UPDATES

A commond error that users of INDEEDopt faces is the generation of bad ffield files. The reason for that is the extra spaces in ffield file that is located in "folder". Pleae clean all extra spaces after each line in ffield file.

Added an example INDEEDopt folder named example_github.zip. (November 2021)

Recent update to some subroutines due to Tensorflow Deep Learning library updates (Feb 2021)
